    Set Placeholder for a Property in a Property Grid in SurveyJS Creator
Problem
You want to set a placeholder for a property, such as the description field, in the property grid of SurveyJS Creator to guide users on what to enter.
Solution
To set a placeholder for a property in the SurveyJS Creator property grid, you can use localization strings to customize the placeholder text. This involves accessing the locale strings for the desired language (e.g., English) and defining the placeholder for the specific property, such as question.description.
The following code demonstrates how to set a placeholder for the description property of questions in the property grid.
Code Example

```js
import { getLocaleStrings } from "survey-creator-core";

// Get the English locale strings
const enLocale = getLocaleStrings("en");

// Check if the question placeholder object exists, if not, create it
if (!enLocale.peplaceholder.question) {
  enLocale.peplaceholder.question = {};
}

// Set the placeholder for the description property of a question
enLocale.peplaceholder.question.description = "Set here the question description";
```

Notes

Replace "en" with the appropriate locale code (e.g., "fr" for French) if you are targeting a different language.
You can extend this approach to other properties by modifying the enLocale.peplaceholder.question object with the desired property names and placeholder text.
The placeholder will appear in the property grid for the specified property, providing guidance to users editing the survey in SurveyJS Creator.
